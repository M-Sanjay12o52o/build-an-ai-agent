The calculator app is a command-line tool that evaluates mathematical expressions. It takes an expression as a string argument, evaluates it using the `Calculator` class from the `pkg` package, and prints the result. The `render` function from the same package is used to format the output. The `tests.py` file contains unit tests for the calculator, covering basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation) with positive and negative numbers, and order of operations.
