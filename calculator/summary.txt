The calculator app takes a mathematical expression as a command-line argument, evaluates it, and prints the result. It uses a Calculator class (likely containing the evaluation logic) and a render function for formatting the output. The app handles potential errors during evaluation. The tests confirm that the calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and handles different data types (integers and floats) and edge cases (division by zero).
